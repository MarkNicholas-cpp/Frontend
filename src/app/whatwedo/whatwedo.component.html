          We will redevelop the slums by using technology. And the process we
          follow is user-friendly. Our project mainly works on user opinion
          only. We will create a user form for the users who are living in the
          slums.

          The people will express their problems to us through our Website. On
          our Website, we have created multiple options for users. If any one of
          the users has not satisfied with the options given by us then the user
          him/herself can type his problem in the description box provided by
          us.

          On this page we have set the boundaries for each and every problem
          faced by them. The agent has to enter the values within the
          boundaries.
